# Recipe App Documentation

## Overview
The Recipe App is a React-based web application that allows users to explore a variety of recipes, including popular dishes, vegetarian options, and recipes from different cuisines. Users can also search for specific recipes and view detailed information, including ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional details.

## Features

### Skeleton Loading:
- Displays skeleton loaders while fetching data for a better user experience.

## How It Works

### Homepage:
